# VBA-challenge

Coming back to this after this long was definitely a challenge but it all started clicking after an hour of working on it.

I had the biggest issue with formatting and getting around excel surprisingly which shouldve been the easiest.

Goal was to write code that went through more than just one excel sheet
Also to append the column necessary after the information the sheet already had in it
Overall simple but messing around with the formatting and desired results was some going back and forth
